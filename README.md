# Prime Group Application

## Elevator Pitch

Our client, "Certain Clean" needed to revamp their process for acquiring new customers. They also needed an application that would be able to scale and handle the addition of new features, and an increase in customer demand.

Myself and a team of three other developers scoped this application for one week, and then built the application in one sprint spanning two weeks.

The result was a reliable and reusable process for new and existing customers to request a highly customized cleaning.  The application also gave the customer instant feedback about how long their cleaning would take, and gave them the autonomy to schedule the cleaning within Certain Clean's availability.  The admin portal equipped Certain Clean with the tools necessary to change this application as customer needs shift, making it flexible and adaptive.  Finally, the preliminary ground work was laid to allow Certain Clean to add new features to the application with relative ease.
